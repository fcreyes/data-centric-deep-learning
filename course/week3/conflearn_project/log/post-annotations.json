I have relaxed 3 times a year or every 4 months\/17 weeks for the past three years. I used Index 2 twice in that time, but I have found that I like Index 1 better because it leaves my hair with just the right amount of texture. I don't prefer a bone straight look to my hair, and most people assume my hair is natural, which is the look I am going for. This product helps me achieve a looser texture while not totally straightening my hair. BTW, I have long (bra strap length) 4a texture hair. Another thing that I like about this product is that it allows me plenty of time for application and smoothing while still not fully processing my hair. I diverge from the instructions quite a bit and have found this to work for me. For instance, I leave this product on a total of 29 minutes instead of 20 as per the directions. My reasoning is this: I don't have fine or thin hair (20 minutes processing time), Index 2 allows 25 minutes, for coarse textures, using Index 1 (which is weaker than Index 2) allows more processing time. I'll be honest and say, again, that even with 29 minutes processing my time, my hair is no where near straight. Also, I am not necessarily recommending this, since everyone's hair is different, Just stating what works for me :)\n\nHowever, this product is not without a few flaws. My main complaint is that it leaves little white flecks in my hair no matter how vigorously or how long I wash. I spend 45 minutes neutralizing my hair and that's not including my deep condition and I will still have white flecks in my hair each time I relax. At first I panicked thinking this was relaxer left on my hair, but after frequent use of this product I have learned that it's not, or at least not active relaxer, and it does not harm my hair. I also don't like how this product comes with 2 applications because I can never use it as such since I always have a ton of new growth and half the container will not be enough. So I end up wasting a lot of product. Would be much easier if they just sold one application sized jars and at a lesser cost. Also I am not a fan of the conditioner. I used to use it faithfully just because it came with the relaxer and so I felt it was formulated to work best with it, but now I use Kerastase conditioner and it leaves my hair much softer. The conditioner that comes with the relaxer tends to leave my hair pretty hard. Also, there is definitely not enough conditioner for 2 relaxer applications, and I find that it doesn't give me enough for even one relaxer session (but my hair is fairly long and relatively thick).\n\nAll of that said, I absolutely love this relaxer despite it's shortcomings and I will never ever switch. Is this relaxer worth the steep price? In my estimation, yes! It keeps my hair in it's healthiest state. My hair is not flat or limp following a relaxer, and my hair retains most of it's strength. Keep in mind that this is still a relaxer like any other, though it claims to be more natural. It smells like good ole fashion perm. But I have never had any issues with scalp irritation even though I leave it on longer than the recommended time. Might I add, that I like following up neutralizing with Roux PC which makes my hair instantly softer."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:14.636702Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:39:40.036919Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":2,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-64160","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:39:56.940665Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:39:56.940683Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":16.683,"prediction":{"id":2,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"11 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"data-64160","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:18.052054Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:18.052059Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":2,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"070ef84f-f675-49cf-bc88-32789427ae1b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":2,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c81ae8c7-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[2],"data":{"text":"I love most of L'occitane product and use them for years: night cream, toner, deodorant, hand lotion, shower gel...This shampoo helps me preventing hair loss in comparison with other shampoo I tried, such as Velvet.

I didn't read through ALL of the other reviews, but most seem to be for shorter term experiences.\n\nFirst off, I am the perfect candidate for this product-- fair skin and dark hair.\n\nAfter nearly two years of use as recommended (every two weeks at first, then every three weeks, etc.) I am using the unit about once a month to hit stray leg hairs and do full armpit treatments. I make sure I do the treatments on skin that is dry and bare (no lotions or deodorant applied). A slight drawback is that I need to allow my leg hair to grow between treatments so I can see where I need to treat. Because the product is best used on short-haired\/shaved skin, at treatment time I dry-shave each visible hair and then zap its follicle. This is the only way to see what areas still need to be treated. If you continue to shave between treatments to get the hairs that remain, you'd have to treat your entire leg each time ($!) to make sure you got all stray hairs.\n\nI have seemingly removed about 50% of my underarm hair.\nI have seemingly removed about 75% of my upper leg hair.\nI have seemingly removed about 85% of my lower leg hair.\nI have seemingly removed about 75% of my bikini line hair.\n\nIf you're looking for absolutely bare legs with no fine hair visible in strong sunlight profile views, this is not your product. The hair that does remain on my legs is finer and seems lighter in color, but it's there and I can see it in good lighting. My legs feel smooth and you'd have to look closely at them to see the hair, so it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nI say \"seemingly\" because I don't know what will happen if I cease to use the product. I suspect the hair will all eventually grow back, as I've read that there really is no such thing as permanent hair removal. For now I'm content with continuing to buy the (expensive!) cartridges because of the time I save on shaving my legs. I still feel the need to shave my underarms every day. The cartridges last much much longer now that I'm not treating my entire legs, so that's a bonus.\n\nI called the \"800\" number to see if the cartridges from the pink retail version (this one) and the giant warehouse store aqua version (name withheld so this review isn't censored) are inter-changeable, and the answer I got was very unsatisfactory. I suspect it's a marketing difference only, as the rep could only keep saying that the retail cartridge would work, but was \"formulated differently\". She couldn't\/wouldn't expound on this. I verified that the pulses were the same in strength and number, and the cartridge is physically identical, so I don't know what other differences there could be.\n\nI gave this product a \"3\" because it does technically work, but it's not the miracle quick hair removal system some marketing campaigns make it out to be. It takes long-term dedication and cartridge purchasing. The real test would be to see how fast all of the hair grows back, but I'm not about to test that after investing the time and money I have to date.\n\nReview update: I failed to mention that I used the unit at its maximum strength (5) pretty much from the start. You can bypass the first 50 pulses of lower strength by following the directions they give.\n\nReview update 2014: I have now used this product for over 3 years. I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars because not only is the machine still working OK, but the hair isn't growing back for the most part, so I'm only doing spot treatments every 2 - 3 months. The percentage of hair removal I mention above is now 70% underarm, 90% upper leg, 95% lower leg, and 85% bikini line. Now that the price seems to have come down substantially I would highly recommend this method to anyone who is willing to work with it long term."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:14.637246Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:40:47.869790Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":5,"annotations":[{"id":5,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-79392","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:41:21.848296Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:41:21.848338Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":33.747,"prediction":{"id":5,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"13 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"data-79392","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:18.052122Z","updated_at":"2024-07-28T23:28:18.052127Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":5,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"4b3f1b95-f927-480d-9b32-fe82a0acc58c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":5,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":5,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c81ae8c7-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[5],"data":{"text":"I've been using Art of Shaving for quite some time.

My hair grows pretty quickly so I found myself shaving 4 times week. This caused me to get ingrown hairs on my face, mostly my neck. I started to look for solutions but there weren't very many. Most of them wanted to me use tweezers to pull out all the ingrown hairs. I don't know about you but, I don't have time to do that. This is where The Art Of Shaving came into play. I found them while looking through a men's magazine(couldn't tell you which one). I ordered the starter pack which was pre-shave oil, badger brush, shaving cream, and after shave lotion. I started out with their lemon scent(I'm a sucker for citrus scents). I loved it and I used it for quite some time. That's until they came out with their Ocean Kelp scent. I wanted to try something new with them and decided to give this scent a try. This is a refreshing scent and it doesn't stick around if you find yourself putting on other stuff on your face such as cologne or body spray. The aftershave lotion with Art of Shaving doesn't contain alcohol so you don't get a burn when putting it on and it doesn't dry out your face.
